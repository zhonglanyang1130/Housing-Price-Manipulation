# Housing-Price-Manipulation
Local authorities found in 2011 that there was housing fraud taking place in several neighborhoods, including NAmes, Gilbert and NridgHt (neighborhoods). In this fraud analytics project, I explored the patterns of suspicious fraud scheme in NAmes and Gilber, and performed sales price manupulation to show how fraudersters could make their fraudulent activitiy harder to detect.
